The World Happiness Report, published by the Denmark-based Happiness Research Institute, proves that the Nordic country is not just a beautiful place, but also a happy one.\r\n\r\nWith their amazing natural environment and penchant for the great outdoors, it’s no wonder the country is peaceful and the people happy. Fittingly, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony is held yearly in Oslo."},{"id":"_zaqv3dfa9","title":"They were originally named Jasper and Jinx.","path":"/images/_hfep410r3.png","description":"The cat — then more of a realistic quadruped — chasing the chubby little mouse was dubbed \"Jasper\" in the debut cartoon, Puss Gets the Boot.
